From this decision, the game came together for me. I made pieces that move like a knight, bishop and rook. (Queen movement was overpowered) Each piece had abilities that gave them purpose. By having more pieces the player has more options to attack without moving, but they have to balance what pieces they want to move out of the way of damage.
