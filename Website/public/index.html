        <p>
            I am a computer science student specializing in
            Web and Mobile Development. In my free time
            I make party games to play with my friends.

            Thank you for checking out my site! I'm a third year undergrad
            studying Computer Science at 
            <a href="https://oregonstate.edu" target="_blank">Oregon State University</a>

            I've been loving problem solving through programming and working 
            with teams and I am excited to get some real world experience.
