WhatToWear
By: Gregory Blood

This site uses darksky.net's API to gather weather data based on the user's
device location. Depending on current temperature, the app will generate the
appropriate clothing to wear. If darksky.net predicts that it will rain anytime 
throughout the day, it will also recommend bringing an umbrella or a raincoat,
depending on the temperature. 

I made this app because every morning when I check the weather I see something
like '54 degrees' and I sometimes forget what that feels like and if I need a 
long sleeve or a heavier jacket. I made the app display what to wear in the simplest 
way possible with bold, large text on a simple background. Nothing more. I set the 
website to show up on my phone's home screen and use it every morning. I love creating 
something practical and helpful, even if I'm the only user.
