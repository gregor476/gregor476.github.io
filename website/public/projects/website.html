        <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I won't go too in depth on for this since you're looking at it 
                right now but I will go in to depth on the reasoning why I made 
                some of my design choices.<br>
                I thought of a sales talk when making this site since both needs to 
                capture attention and deliver information clearly. I made sure to 
                keep the site clean through using minimilistic design with a small 
                color pallete to identify background, text, and links.<br>
                The website also has small animations for hovering buttons to make the 
                page more alive and fun to explore.<br><br>
                The original color scheme of the website was after the popular Monokai 
                theme so many programmers are used to seeing. I changed from this design 
                because it felt too dull. The dark grey background and multiple colors made 
                for a messy looking website I felt didn't represent me. <br><br>

                While it is subject to change and evolve, this site taught me a lot about 
                blending creative ideas with practical design. I learned that each choice I 
                made had hidden functions, both good and bad, and that planning before building 
                is crucial to a functional project.
