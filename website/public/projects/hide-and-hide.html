        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            This game is a maze horror game with the objective being to collect all five of the 
            green fuel cells. The problem is that multiple floating killer robots of doom 
            are after you. If they see you they will chase you until you break line of sight 
            by either running around a wall while far, or hiding under one of the many blue 
            tables. But doing this doesn't mean you're safe as they will go towards your last 
            known position.

        <h2>About</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    I don't know why but this game kind of came to me in a dream, or I guess 
                    better put would be a nightmare. Something about ominous red lights in a 
                    maze blended horror and aesthetic. When I was planning how to make it a 
                    game I kind of thought of a Pac-Man like maze, then I thought, why not just 
                    theme it like Pac-Man? The player has some familiarity with the map if they've 
                    played the classic arcade game and they know at least four fuel cells are in 
                    the corners.
                </p>
            <h3>Requirements</h3>
                <p>
                    This game heavily relied on A.I. The player had to believe that the robots of doom 
                    were dangerous because they're smart. I made sure the robots had a field of view, view 
                    limit, and random patrolling paths too keep every playthrough feeling different. 
                    <br><br>
                    Another Important part of the game is that it felt scary. This was definitely one of the 
                    most difficult tasks of any horror related media. While certainly not a nightmare to play, 
                    I did do a few things I felt would add some scare factor, at least enough so the player would 
                    be on edge if they were alone at night.<br><br>
                    First off all the robots have a menacing red light that glows brighter when they lock on the player. 
                    <br>Second, they play have a constant sound I made with modified audio of me whipping a metal 
                    sign around. This also increases in pitch and speed when the robot locks on the player. 
                    <br>Lastly when the robots close in, the players screen shakes and becomes tunneled, both increasing 
                    the closer the robot gets until the get caught.<br><br>
                    To make the player more tense, I added hiding spots that break the vision of the robots. 
                    It isn't a completely safe place because the robots can see you enter them and still catch you.
