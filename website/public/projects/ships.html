        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            This game is a 2-4 player party game in which players control a 
            pirate ship and must shoot cannons to destroy other ships. 
            The niche to the game is that to reload the cannonballs, the 
            player must reload by spinning a joystick in rotation, wish 
            increasing amounts of loaded ammo for consecutive spinning. A 
            player wins when they are the last boat standing.<br><br>This game 
            has an alternate version where two people control the same boat, 
            one person steers and the other shoots and reloads.
