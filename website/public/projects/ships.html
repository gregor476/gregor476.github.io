        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            This game is a 2-4 player party game in which players control a 
            pirate ship and must shoot cannons to destroy other ships. 
            The niche to the game is that to reload the cannonballs, the 
            player must spin a joystick in rotation. The more 
            consecutive spins without fire grant more ammo per spin. They can 
            fire the cannonballs from either side of the ship, depleting 15 rounds 
            per trigger pull a maximum of four times. There's and island that can be 
            shot over at the cost of a chance a ball hits the ground and flies 
            uncontrollably in the air. 
            A player wins when they are the last boat standing.<br><br>This game 
            has an alternate version where two people control the same boat, 
            one person steers and the other shoots and reloads.

        <h2>About</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a fun party game to play with my friends in 
                    the summer. The theme had to be fun for everyone and able to be made 
                    with my 3D modeling skills. I landed on the idea that pirate ships would 
                    be a perfect fit and begin thinking about gameplay elements. I started a 
                    blank document and filled it with bulleted ideas. I then shaved ideas down 
                    to get to core elements of the game. I decided a 2D top down with joystick 
                    controllers would be the best start for a party game. I then thought something 
                    interactive would also be a must to make the game engaging. Once I had the idea 
                    built in my head, I booted up Unity3D.<br><br>

                    The game I prototyped looked similar to the game I have now. It was 2-4 minimalistic 
                    ships with UI around them. I did this because I wanted everyone to just be able to 
                    focus on their ship. Originally, I had random buttons display to indicate what the player 
                    should press to reload a cannonball. It was color coded and position relative. (So the b 
                    button was red and to the right like the targeted controllers) I did a test run with my 
                    dad who has used xbox controllers before, but still needed to look at the controller time to 
                    time. I whooped him in many of the games due to my familiarity with controllers. But 
                    while it was fun to beat him, this wasn't the purpose of the game and I wasn't the target 
                    audience. I then switched it to the current joystick spinning system with indicators for 
                    the direction needed to spin. This worked perfectly as players didn't need to lift their 
                    thumbs but still felt pressured to reload quicker than an opponent.<br><br>
                    Another issue was steering. I always imagined the best method was the ship points to the 
                    direction of the left joystick. When playing that first test run with my dad however, it 
                    didn't feel natural. He was use to steering with the left stick. I made a change to see 
                    how I liked steering the ship with only left and right and I felt indifferent about it. 
                    I kept the changes when I tested a later version with my friends who were familiar with 
                    controllers and different genres of games and they prefered the original way, so I reverted 
                    it back. Controlling choices are definitely a feature I will add later to please both groups. 
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, with gameplay out of the way, I created extra effects like explosions, cannonball trails, 
                    and planks flying off the ships when they got hit. With a bit of music, a custom water shader, and 
                    my own sound effects, the game became what I wanted: Fun to quickly play with anyone.
