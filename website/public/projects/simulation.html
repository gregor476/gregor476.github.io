        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            This is a current project I'm working on because I like feeling like a data collection 
            god. The purpose of the simulation is to see how different factors affect species evolution. 
            Each creature, or "Joups" as I call them, collect the closest food. Once they have enough 
            energy, they reproduce, creating a child with similar stats. There's a chance the child will 
            be a mutation and have completely different stats. <br>
            Species live and die depending on how efficient they are. Their effieciency is based from their 
            speed and size.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Efficiency</h2>
        <p>
            This was a hard calculation to find. I wanted the simulation to be similar to nature. Each joup 
            loses 0.1 energy per second and gain 1 energy per food they eat. The faster a creature gets, 
            the less efficient they should be with their energy that they get from food. 
            In nature, this relation seems exponential so it began with energy loss per second = speed^2. 
            Doing this with made two groupds of creatures, fast ones that were able to steal food from others, 
            and incredibly slow ones that were very efficient. Less food placed per second in the 
            environment benifited the faster joups as they could take more food from slower ones, causing the 
            slow to starve out. <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Competition</h2>
        <p>
            Due to competition, the overall average speed increased, the less total creatures could survive. This 
            is because overall, the creatures are less efficient with their food.
